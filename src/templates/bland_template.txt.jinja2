Mostly to prove that the {{ code_type|lower }} code worked.

Let's list some things:
{% for row in row_list -%}
    {{ loop.index }}. {% if loop.index is even %}{{ "'%s'"|format(row|title) }}{% else %}{{ row|title }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Oof. Ouch. Owie. My recursion
{% for list_row in nested_list -%}
    Using list. {{ loop.index }}
        {% for row in list_row -%}
            {{ loop.index }}: {{ row }}
        {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Haha, managing to quote things is complicated.
